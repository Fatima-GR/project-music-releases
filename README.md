# Music Releases
Practicing React and creating components by using data from Spotify. We built a page which shows new album and single releases. This project was done pair programming by Fatima Gamero Romero & Amanda Tilly.

## The project

The project includes:

- Our app has 3 components called Album, Artist and Header.
- Our page looks like the design provided.
- The following is displayed for each album:
    - album cover image
    - album name
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- Hover effects:
    - When you hover over an album, it goes darker, it show's a play button, a favourite button, and an ellipsis
    - When you hover over the play button, it grows
    - Hovering an artist name or an album name matches the design sketch
- When you click on the album, it links to the album's external url in the data
- When you click on an artist, it links to the artist's external url in the data
- Our page is responsive:
    - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    - 2 per row on tablet
    - 1 per row on mobile.
